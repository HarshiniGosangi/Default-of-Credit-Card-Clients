# Default-of-Credit-Card-Clients
We have been a dataset contains data regarding details of 30,000 customer for 5 months which is taken from the bank. The task is to see which variables are the strongest predictors of default, and to make predictions on which customers are likely to default the next month.
This project presents and discusses data-driven predictive models for predicting the defaulters
among the credit card users. Data used include details like limit balance, age, sex, amount of bill
statement, repayment status and amount of previous payment. The paper discusses which variables
are the strongest predictors of default, and to make predictions on which customers are likely to
default. Four machine learning models were trained with repeated cross validation and evaluated
in a testing set: (a) logistic regression,(b)KNN, (c) decision tree, (d) Na√Øve Bayes ,(e)Random
Forest and Ensembling methods like Boosting and Bagging. The base model gave 81% R-square
value with all the variables without any treatment.
